# Trigger conditions for the workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: ["master"] # Trigger on pushes to the 'master' branch
    tags:
      - "v*" # Trigger on tags starting with 'v' (e.g., v1.0.0)
  pull_request:
    branches: ["master"] # Trigger on pull requests targeting the 'master' branch

# Jobs define the tasks to be executed
jobs:
  # Job 1: Build and Test (runs for all commits, including PRs and non-tag pushes)
  build-and-test:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Standard way to fetch the repository code in GitHub Actions

      # Step 2: Set up the Go environment
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version-file: "go.mod" # Automatically detect the Go version from go.mod

      # Step 3: Build the Go project
      - name: Build
        run: go build -v ./... # Build the project with verbose output

      # Step 4: Run tests for the Go project
      - name: Test
        run: go test -v ./... # Run tests with verbose output

  # Job 2: Release (runs only for tags starting with 'v')
  release:
    name: Release

    permissions:

        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
