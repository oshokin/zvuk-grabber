# Zvuk Grabber üéµ

[Zvuk (–ó–≤—É–∫)](https://zvuk.com/) grabber written in Go.\
This tool allows you to download artists, albums, tracks, and playlists from Zvuk.

* * *

## Quick Start üöÄ

1. **Download the Latest Release**:  
   Grab the pre-built binary for your OS from the [Releases page](https://github.com/oshokin/zvuk-grabber/releases).

2. **Extract the Archive**:  
   Just extract the archive! It already has everything you need inside.
   - For macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     tar -xvzf zvuk-grabber_1.0.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
     ```

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     unzip zvuk-grabber_1.0.0_windows_amd64.zip
     ```

3. **Set Up Authentication Token**:  

   **Option 1: Automatic Browser Login (Recommended)**

   Run the interactive login command:

   ```bash
   zvuk-grabber auth login
   ```

   This will:
   - Open a browser window
   - Let you log in manually (phone number + SMS code)
   - Automatically extract and save your auth token
   - Update your `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` configuration

   **Option 2: Manual Token Extraction**

   Open the `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` file and set your `auth_token`.\
   You can obtain it by logging into [Zvuk's API](https://zvuk.com/api/v2/tiny/profile) and locating the token in the JSON response using the JSON path `$.result.profile.token`.

4. **Run the Tool**:  
   - **Linux/macOS**:

     ```bash
     chmod +x zvuk-grabber  # Make it executable
     ./zvuk-grabber         # Let it rip!
     ```

   - **Windows**:

     ```bash
     zvuk-grabber           # Run the executable
     ```

5. **Enjoy Your Music!** üé∂  
   Start downloading your favorite tracks, albums, and playlists.

## Authentication üîê

### Browser-Based Login (The Easy Way)

**I've wanted to automate the authentication cookie extraction for ages!** But as we all know, UI/UX automation is usually painful because we approach the website like a black box and poke it with a stick hoping to discover the right behavior and side effects. Like a blind chicken in the dark, basically.

**But IT WORKS!** Well... mostly.

#### The Good News

Run this command and watch the magic happen:

```bash
zvuk-grabber auth login
```

This will:

1. Open a browser window (Chrome/Chromium) with **stealth mode** enabled
2. Navigate to the Zvuk homepage (to establish proper origin for OAuth)
3. Wait for you to manually log in (phone number + SMS code)
4. **Simulate human behavior** while waiting (mouse movements, scrolling, random delays)
5. Detect when login completes and OAuth flow finishes
6. Extract the `auth` cookie from your browser
7. Save it to `.zvuk-grabber.yaml`
8. Close the browser and celebrate

#### Anti-Bot Detection Stack

The tool employs multiple techniques to evade bot detection:

1. **Stealth Mode** ([go-rod/stealth](https://github.com/go-rod/stealth))
   - Hides `navigator.webdriver` flag
   - Patches browser automation signatures
   - Spoofs plugin lists and permissions
   - Makes CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) invisible

2. **Human Behavior Simulation**
   - Random mouse movements across the page
   - Occasional scrolling (up/down)
   - Variable timing between actions (500ms-2s)
   - Random pauses to mimic reading/thinking
   - Randomized interaction patterns

3. **Fresh Browser Profile**
   - Each login uses a temporary incognito profile
   - No persistent cookies or history between sessions
   - Clean slate helps avoid detection patterns

4. **Smart OAuth Flow**
   - Starts on `zvuk.com` domain (not login page directly)
   - Avoids CORS errors during OAuth callback
   - Bypasses broken automatic redirects manually
   - Detects auth cookie directly without rate-limited API calls

#### The Bad News (Windows Edition)

On **Windows 10 with ESET Security**, you might get a fun notification that our code is infected with some virus. **It's not.** Both this project and `go-rod` have source code available - feel free to audit it yourself.

**TL;DR: It's a false positive. Ignore the warning or whitelist the application.**

#### Troubleshooting Login Issues

If the login process gets stuck or fails:

1. **Enable debug logging** in `.zvuk-grabber.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   log_level: debug
   ```

2. **Run the command again**:

   ```bash
   zvuk-grabber auth login
   ```

3. **Create an issue** with the debug output

And if the moon phase is in the right wavelength of light and Mercury's retrograde isn't too retrograde, I might just take a look at what's going on in your code.

#### Known Issues

- **CORS/API Issues**: Zvuk's OAuth callback sometimes fails with CORS errors. The tool now automatically bypasses this by manually redirecting to the main page.
- **Rate Limiting**: If you try too many times, Zvuk might rate-limit you. The tool now minimizes API calls during login to avoid this.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works best with Chrome/Chromium. Firefox might work but is untested.
- **Cleanup Warnings**: You might see warnings about temp directory cleanup on Windows. This is normal and non-critical - Chrome takes time to release file locks.

### Manual Token Extraction (The Old-School Way)

If the browser automation fails or you prefer doing things manually:

1. **Log in to Zvuk** in your browser
2. **Navigate to** [https://zvuk.com/api/v2/tiny/profile](https://zvuk.com/api/v2/tiny/profile)
3. **Find the token** in the JSON response at `$.result.profile.token`
4. **Copy it** to `.zvuk-grabber.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   auth_token: "your_token_here"
   ```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The default configuration is already set in the `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` file.\
You only need to modify it if you want to customize the behavior.\
Key options include:

### Authentication

- **`auth_token`**: Your Zvuk API authentication token.\
    **Easiest way**: Run `zvuk-grabber auth login` to automatically extract it.\
    **Manual way**: Log in to [Zvuk's API](https://zvuk.com/api/v2/tiny/profile) and locate the token using the JSON path `$.result.profile.token`.  
    Example:

    ```yaml
    auth_token: "a3f8e7b2c5d946f1a0b9e8d7c6f5e4a2"
    ```

### Audio Quality

- **`quality`**: Preferred audio quality for downloaded files.\
    Available options:
  - `1` = MP3, 128 Kbps (standard quality)
  - `2` = MP3, 320 Kbps (high quality)
  - `3` = FLAC, 16/24-bit (lossless quality)
    Example:

    ```yaml
    quality: 3
    ```

- **`min_quality`**: Minimum acceptable quality (tracks below this will be skipped).\
    Available options:
  - `0` = No filtering (accept any quality) - default
  - `1` = Skip tracks only available in MP3 128 Kbps or lower
  - `2` = Skip tracks only available in MP3 320 Kbps or lower (FLAC only)
  - `3` = Skip tracks only available in FLAC or lower (impossible - FLAC is max)

    **Example 1** - Download FLAC preferred, but accept MP3 320 minimum:

    ```yaml
    quality: 3
    min_quality: 2
    ```

    **Example 2** - FLAC only, skip everything else:

    ```yaml
    quality: 3
    min_quality: 3
    ```

    **Note**: `min_quality` must be less than or equal to `quality`.

- **`min_duration`**: Minimum acceptable track duration (tracks shorter than this will be skipped).\
    Use duration strings like `30s`, `1m`, `1m30s`.\
    Empty string = no filtering (default).

    **Example uses**:
  - Skip intros/interludes/skits (common in hip-hop albums)
  - Skip sound effects and ambient noise
  - Filter out incomplete/sample tracks

    ```yaml
    min_duration: "30s"  # Skip tracks shorter than 30 seconds
    ```

- **`max_duration`**: Maximum acceptable track duration (tracks longer than this will be skipped).\
    Use duration strings like `10m`, `15m`, `1h`.\
    Empty string = no filtering (default).

    **Example uses**:
  - Skip DJ mixes and extended live versions
  - Skip very long classical pieces or ambient tracks
  - Filter out podcasts/interviews mistakenly tagged as music

    ```yaml
    max_duration: "10m"  # Skip tracks longer than 10 minutes
    ```

    **Combined Example** - Only download "normal" songs (30s to 10min):

    ```yaml
    min_duration: "30s"
    max_duration: "10m"
    ```

    **Note**: If both are set, `max_duration` must be greater than `min_duration`.

### Output Settings

- **`output_path`**: Directory where downloaded files will be saved.\
    You can specify either a relative path (e.g., `"zvuk downloads"`) or an absolute path (e.g., `"C:/Music"`).\
    Example:

    ```yaml
    output_path: "zvuk downloads"
    ```

- **`create_folder_for_singles`**: Whether to create a separate folder for single tracks (tracks not part of an album).\
    If set to `false`, single tracks will be saved directly in the output directory.\
    Example:

    ```yaml
    create_folder_for_singles: false
    ```

- **`max_folder_name_length`**: Maximum length for folder names created by the application.\
    This ensures folder names remain readable and compatible across different operating systems.\
    Set to `0` to avoid cutting folder names.\
    Example:

    ```yaml
    max_folder_name_length: 100
    ```

### File Naming Templates

- **`track_filename_template`**: Track file naming format.\

    Helps avoid hitting API rate limits or temporary failures.\
    Example:

    ```yaml
    min_retry_pause: "3s"
    ```

- **`max_retry_pause`**: Maximum pause duration before retrying a failed download attempt.\
    Randomized between `min_retry_pause` and `max_retry_pause` for better resilience.\
    Example:

    ```yaml
    max_retry_pause: "7s"
    ```

### Concurrent Downloads

- **`max_concurrent_downloads`**: Maximum number of tracks to download simultaneously.\
    **Default: `1` (sequential downloads - safest and recommended)**\
    \
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: Using values greater than 1 may:**
  - Trigger API rate limiting
  - Lead to temporary or permanent account restrictions from Zvuk
  - Disable progress bars (to avoid terminal output conflicts)
    \
    **Use at your own risk.** By increasing this value, you acknowledge that:
  - You are responsible for any consequences, including account blocking
  - This tool's authors are not liable for any service restrictions
  - Sequential downloads (value=1) are the recommended and tested approach
    \
    Example:

    ```yaml
    max_concurrent_downloads: 1  # Recommended default
    ```

    If you want faster downloads despite the risks:

    ```yaml
    max_concurrent_downloads: 3  # Use with caution!
    ```

### Logging

- **`log_level`**: Logging level for the application.\
    Available options: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`.\
    Default: `info`.\
    Example:

    ```yaml
    log_level: "debug"
    ```

## Troubleshooting üêõ

Having trouble? Follow these steps:

1. **Check Your Configuration File**:\
   Before blaming the code (or me), check if your `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` is up to date.\
   New releases might add new settings with shiny features. If you're using an ancient config file from the Stone Age, weird things might happen.\
   \
   **Quick fix**: Compare your config with the one from the [latest release](https://github.com/oshokin/zvuk-grabber/releases) and add any missing fields.\
   \
   **Pro tip**: If something breaks after an update and you haven't touched your config file in months... yeah, that's probably why.

2. **Enable Debug Logging**:\
   Set the `log_level` to `debug` in the `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   log_level: "debug"
   ```

   Attach the logs when reporting issues.

3. **Check Your Token**:\
    Ensure your `auth_token` is valid and properly set in the `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` file.\
    If it's not working, run `zvuk-grabber auth login` to get a fresh token.

4. **Check Your Internet Connection**:\
    A stable connection is essential. If downloads are failing, wait a moment and try again.

5. **Check Zvuk's API Status**:\
    If Zvuk's API is down, check their website or API status page for updates.
