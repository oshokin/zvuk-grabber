Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
-------------

The default configuration is already set in the `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` file.\
You only need to modify it if you want to customize the behavior.\
Key options include:

### Authentication

*   **`auth_token`**: Your Zvuk API authentication token.\
    To obtain your token, log in to [Zvuk's API](https://zvuk.com/api/v2/tiny/profile) and locate the token using the JSON path `$.result.profile.token`.  
    Example:

    ```yaml
    auth_token: "a3f8e7b2c5d946f1a0b9e8d7c6f5e4a2"
    ```

### Audio Format

*   **`download_format`**: Preferred audio format for downloaded files.\
    Available options:
    *   `1` = MP3, 128 Kbps (standard quality)
    *   `2` = MP3, 320 Kbps (high quality)
    *   `3` = FLAC, 16/24-bit (lossless quality)
    Example:
    ```yaml
    download_format: 3
    ```

### Output Settings

*   **`output_path`**: Directory where downloaded files will be saved.\
    You can specify either a relative path (e.g., `"zvuk downloads"`) or an absolute path (e.g., `"C:/Music"`).\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    output_path: "zvuk downloads"
    ```

*   **`create_folder_for_singles`**: Whether to create a separate folder for single tracks (tracks not part of an album).\
    If set to `false`, single tracks will be saved directly in the output directory.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    create_folder_for_singles: false
    ```

*   **`max_folder_name_length`**: Maximum length for folder names created by the application.\
    This ensures folder names remain readable and compatible across different operating systems.\
    Set to `0` to avoid cutting folder names.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    max_folder_name_length: 100
    ```

### File Naming Templates

*   **`track_filename_template`**: Track file naming format.\
    Available placeholders:
    *   `{{.albumArtist}}`: Primary artist(s) of the album.
    *   `{{.albumID}}`: Unique identifier for the album.
    *   `{{.albumTitle}}`: Title of the album.
    *   `{{.albumTrackCount}}`: Total number of tracks in the album.
    *   `{{.collectionTitle}}`: Title of the album.
    *   `{{.recordLabel}}`: Name of the record label.
    *   `{{.releaseDate}}`: Full release date of the album (YYYY-MM-DD format).
    *   `{{.releaseYear}}`: Year the album was released.
    *   `{{.trackArtist}}`: Artist(s) of the track.
    *   `{{.trackCount}}`: Total number of tracks in the album.
    *   `{{.trackGenre}}`: Genre(s) of the track.
    *   `{{.trackID}}`: Unique identifier for the track.
    *   `{{.trackNumber}}`: Track number within the album (without leading zeros).
    *   `{{.trackNumberPad}}`: Track number with two-digit padding (e.g., 01, 02).
    *   `{{.trackTitle}}`: Track title.
    *   `{{.type}}`: "album" (used to differentiate album tracks).

    Example:
    ```yaml
    track_filename_template: "{{.trackNumberPad}} - {{.trackTitle}}"
    ```

*   **`album_folder_template`**: Album folder naming format.\
    Available placeholders:
    *   `{{.albumArtist}}`: Primary artist(s) of the album.
    *   `{{.albumID}}`: Unique identifier for the album.
    *   `{{.albumTitle}}`: Title of the album.
    *   `{{.albumTrackCount}}`: Total number of tracks in the album.
    *   `{{.releaseDate}}`: Full release date of the album (YYYY-MM-DD format).
    *   `{{.releaseYear}}`: Year the album was released.
    *   `{{.type}}`: "album" (used to differentiate albums from playlists).

    **Folder Structure Tip**: Use `/` or `\` in your template to create nested subfolders.\
    Both separators work universally across operating systems - we'll automatically convert them to your system's native format.\
    Examples:
    ```yaml
    # Unix-style path (recommended)
    album_folder_template: "Artists/{{.albumArtist}}/{{.releaseYear}} - {{.albumTitle}}"

    # Windows-style path (escaped backslash)
    album_folder_template: "Music\\{{.albumArtist}}\\{{.releaseYear}} - {{.albumTitle}}"

    # Flat structure alternative
    album_folder_template: "{{.releaseYear}} - {{.albumArtist}} - {{.albumTitle}}"
    ```

*   **`playlist_filename_template`**: Playlist file naming format.\
    Available placeholders:
    *   `{{.albumArtist}}`: Primary artist(s) of the album containing the track.
    *   `{{.albumID}}`: Unique identifier for the album containing the track.
    *   `{{.albumTitle}}`: Title of the album containing the track.
    *   `{{.albumTrackCount}}`: Total number of tracks in the album.
    *   `{{.collectionTitle}}`: Title of the playlist.

    *   `{{.playlistTitle}}`: Title of the playlist.
    *   `{{.playlistTrackCount}}`: Total number of tracks in the playlist.
    *   `{{.recordLabel}}`: Name of the record label.
    *   `{{.releaseDate}}`: Full release date of the album containing the track (YYYY-MM-DD format).
    *   `{{.releaseYear}}`: Year the album containing the track was released.
    *   `{{.trackArtist}}`: Artist(s) of the track.
    *   `{{.trackCount}}`: Total number of tracks in the playlist.
    *   `{{.trackGenre}}`: Genre(s) of the track.
    *   `{{.trackID}}`: Unique identifier for the track.
    *   `{{.trackNumber}}`: Track number within the playlist (without leading zeros).
    *   `{{.trackNumberPad}}`: Track number with two-digit padding (e.g., 01, 02).
    *   `{{.trackTitle}}`: Track title.
    *   `{{.type}}`: "playlist" (used to differentiate playlists from albums).

    Example:
    ```yaml
    playlist_filename_template: "{{.trackNumberPad}} - {{.trackArtist}} - {{.trackTitle}}"
    ```

### Download Behavior

*   **`download_lyrics`**: Whether to download lyrics for tracks (if available).\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    download_lyrics: true
    ```

*   **`replace_tracks`**: Whether to overwrite existing track files.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    replace_tracks: false
    ```

*   **`replace_covers`**: Whether to overwrite existing cover art files.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    replace_covers: false
    ```

*   **`replace_lyrics`**: Whether to overwrite existing lyric files.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    replace_lyrics: false
    ```

*   **`download_speed_limit`**: Limit download speed (e.g., `"1MB"` for 1 MB/s).\
    Set to empty or `0` for unlimited speed.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    download_speed_limit: ""
    ```

### Retry and Pause Settings

*   **`retry_attempts_count`**: Number of retry attempts before giving up on a failed download.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    retry_attempts_count: 5
    ```

*   **`max_download_pause`**: Maximum pause duration between track downloads (to mimic human behavior).\
    This value is in Go duration format (e.g., `"2s"` for 2 seconds).\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    max_download_pause: "2s"
    ```

*   **`min_retry_pause`**: Minimum pause duration before retrying a failed download attempt.\
    Helps avoid hitting API rate limits or temporary failures.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    min_retry_pause: "3s"
    ```

*   **`max_retry_pause`**: Maximum pause duration before retrying a failed download attempt.\
    Randomized between `min_retry_pause` and `max_retry_pause` for better resilience.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    max_retry_pause: "7s"
    ```

### Logging

*   **`log_level`**: Logging level for the application.\
    Available options: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`.\
    Default: `info`.\
    Example:
    ```yaml
    log_level: "debug"
    ```

* * *

Troubleshooting üêõ
------------------

Having trouble? Follow these steps:

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:\
   Set the `log_level` to `debug` in the `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   log_level: "debug"
   ```
   Attach the logs when reporting issues.

2. **Check Your Token**:\
    Ensure your `auth_token` is valid and properly set in the `.zvuk-grabber.yaml` file.\
    If it's not working, log in again and obtain a new token.

3. **Check Your Internet Connection**:\
    A stable connection is essential. If downloads are failing, wait a moment and try again.

4. **Check Zvuk's API Status**:\
    If Zvuk's API is down, check their website or API status page for updates.
